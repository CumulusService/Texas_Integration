# Texas_Integration
This repository provides you with an overview of your running Function Apps and related workflows for your Logia Integration Service.

The extracted code is a collection of workflows and services bound to cloud Function Apps. In most cases, the code snippets you will see have been generated by appending multiple code snippets that point to the same Function App.

This code interacts with the on-premises environment and its local resources (e.g., IF Server) via a VNet integration with an outbound IP (NAT gateway): 172.201.66.176.

Important: The code is not executable and will not work due to the lack of dependencies, deployed services, and the underlying compute resources tied to the resource group.

The code uses managed identities, which means that resources residing in other code spaces (e.g., the Power Platform) were excluded from this extract. However, the Function Apps do invoke them in certain cases.

Excluded Resources
The following resources are excluded from this repository:

Logia Stock Schedule: A web app that allows users to set the run schedule interactively.
Integration Monitor: A web app developed to monitor outbound/inbound traffic and resubmit failed jobs. Development is partially completed (70%-80% done); progress halted when the project was suspended.
Logia Sync Data Flow: An Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline that retrieves data from an Oracle DB, performs numerous data manipulations, and prepares it for the Function App to execute. There is no code to extract here, as it is based on DAX expressions and Power BI engines that are tenant-specific.
Dataverse Tables: Used inherently by M365 Apps and could not be extracted. Multiple Function Apps read from and write to these tables.
